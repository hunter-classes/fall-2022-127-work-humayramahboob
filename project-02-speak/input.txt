Hello , my name is Benjamin. I have very little friends in school. People always thought of me as weird because I am a shy bookworm. Girls would run away from me and boys would laugh at me. One day, I met a pair of twins who were sitting alone, a boy and a girl. She was shorter than him and he was more athletic than her. I sat next to them and started talking. Her name was Linda and his name was Landon. We became the best of friends and are now still friends till this day.
