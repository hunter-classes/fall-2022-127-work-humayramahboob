Once upon a time, there was a person living in the mountains. 
Their name was <MAIN> and they fear everytime they will see something new.
They were running out of <NOUN> so they went adventuring. 
After exploring for a bit they found a <NOUN> and it started to <VERB> .
<MAIN> didn't know if they were fascinated by that or terrified.
<MAIN> feels hopeless and starts to walk back because they didn't find anything for a long time.
On their way back, they encountered a person who was about to approach them. 
The person said, 'Give me <NOUN> or else!' and <MAIN> started running. 
As they try to escape, they trip over a <NOUN> and falls down the mountains.
They soon starved to death as no one found them for a while.
